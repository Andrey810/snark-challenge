Welcome to the SNARK challenge! The SNARK challenge is a
global competition to advance the state-of-the-art in performance
for SNARK proving. Participants will be part of an effort that aims
to have a massive impact on user-protecting cryptographic technology,
and compete for $100,000 in prizes.

There are two categories of challenges: those for programmers who want
to implement high-performance cryptography, and those for cryptographers
who want to advance the state-of-the-art in efficiency of the underlying
elliptic-curves powering SNARK constructions. Click through to the individual challenge
pages for more details.

<!--
The SNARK challenge is divided
up into two stages. In the first stage, you'll get your feet wet and
learn about the algorithms underlying the SNARK prover.
Think of this stage as a paid training for the ultimate challenge
of writing a super-fast SNARK prover. There are $5,000 in prizes in
this stage.

The second stage is the main stage of the competition.
There are $95,000 in prizes including $55,000 for speeding up the
[Groth16 prover](/snark-challenge/problem-07-groth16-prover-challenges.html) and $20,000 for developing better cryptographic
primitives. Here you'll apply GPU programming and techniques for
speeding up elliptic-curve and finite-field arithmetic to try
to build the fastest possible [Groth16 prover](/snark-challenge/problem-07-groth16-prover-challenges.html).-->
