Welcome to the SNARK challenge! The SNARK challenge is a
global competition to advance the state-of-the-art in performance
for SNARK proving. Participants will be part of an effort that aims
to have a massive impact on user-protecting cryptographic technology,
and compete for $100,000 in prizes.

There are two categories of challenges: those for programmers who want
to implement high-performance cryptography, and those for cryptographers
who want to advance the state-of-the-art in efficiency of the underlying
elliptic-curves powering SNARK constructions. Click through to the individual challenge
pages for more details.
