    <h1 id="snark-challenge-stage-1"><em>SNARK Challenge</em>: Stage 1</h1>
    <p>Welcome to stage 1 of the SNARK challenge! Think of this stage as a paid training for the ultimate challenge of writing a super-fast SNARK prover. Want to learn cutting edge cryptography, GPU programming and get paid to do it? Then you're in the right place.</p>
    <p>In this stage, you'll implement the sub-algorithms you need to implement the full SNARK prover and you'll get paid to do so. The first 25 participants who complete the four challenges in this stage will receive $200 and a <em>SNARK Challenge</em> swag-bag. They'll also be very well positioned to apply their solutions to create submissions for the $95,000 in prizes up for grabs in the second stage.</p>
    <p>Let's dive into it and give a quick overview of the SNARK prover so we have an idea of where we're going. The SNARK prover itself consists of two sub-algorithms:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Multi-exponentiation on an elliptic curve.</li>
    <li>Fast fourier transform (FFT) over a finite field.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The cool thing about both of these algorithms is that they're massively parallel and ideally suited to implementation on GPU, which we expect to help take the top prize in the challenge. The multi-exponentiation in particular is just a big <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf">reduction</a>, although the reduction function requires some work to describe.</p>
    <p>These 2 algorithms themselves have sub-algorithms which you'll need to implement first. All in all, there are N challenges:</p>
    <h2 id="the-stage-1-challenges">The stage 1 challenges</h2>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li><a href="/snark-challenge/problem-Field%20arithmetic.html">Finite field arithmetic</a>. Reward of $50.</li>
    <li><a href="/snark-challenge/problem-Quadratic%20extension%20arithmetic.html">Quadratic extension arithmetic</a>. Reward of $25.</li>
    <li><a href="/snark-challenge/problem-Cubic%20extension%20arithmetic.html">Cubic extension arithmetic</a>. Reward of $25.</li>
    <li><a href="/snark-challenge/problem-Curve%20operations.html">Elliptic curve operations</a>. Reward of $100.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You'll want to get started with the first challenge, <a href="/snark-challenge/problem-Field%20arithmetic.html">finite field arithmetic</a>, and work your way through the others. If you want to get a sense for how all these algorithms come together to build the whole prover, check out <a href="/snark-challenge/intro.html">this page</a>.</p>
